# File Templates

`workflow-file-templates.zip` can be imported into Android Studio / IntelliJ IDEA to add a few Workflow-specific file templates, via _File > Manage IDE Settings > Import Settings…_.

To update the templates:

* edit them in the IDE (_Settings > Editor > File and Code Templates_)
* export them (_File > Manage IDE Settings > Import Settings…_), taking care to clear every checkbox except that for File Templates.
