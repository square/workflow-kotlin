/**
 * A composable, stateful object that can [handle events][RenderContext.actionSink],
 * [delegate to children][RenderContext.renderChild], [subscribe][RenderContext.runningWorker] to
 * arbitrary asynchronous events from the outside world, and be [saved][snapshotState] to a
 * serialized form to be restored later.
 *
 * The basic purpose of a `Workflow` is to take some [props][PropsT] and return a
 * [rendering][RenderingT] that serves as a public representation of its current state,
 * and which can be used to update that state. A rendering typically serves as a view  model,
 * though this is not assumed, and is not the only use case.
 *
 * To that end, a workflow may keep track of internal [state][StateT],
 * recursively ask other workflows to render themselves, subscribe to data streams from the outside
 * world, and handle events both from its [renderings][RenderContext.actionSink] and from
 * workflows it's delegated to (its "children"). A `Workflow` may also emit
 * [output events][OutputT] up to its parent `Workflow`.
 *
 * Workflows form a tree, where each workflow can have zero or more child workflows. Child workflows
 * are started as necessary whenever another workflow asks for them, and are cleaned up
 * automatically when they're no longer needed. [Props][PropsT] propagate down the tree,
 * [outputs][OutputT] and [renderings][RenderingT] propagate up the tree.
 *
 * ## Avoid capturing stale state
 *
 * Workflows may not perform side effects in their `render` methods, but may perform side effects by
 * running [Worker]s and getting events from [RenderingT]s via [WorkflowAction]s. A [WorkflowAction]
 * defines how to update the [StateT] and what [OutputT]s to emit. Actions get access to the current
 * workflow's state, and they must use that view of the state. If an action is defined inline, it is
 * incorrect to capture, or close over, the [StateT] passed to [render] in the action. Workflows are
 * executed synchronously, but external events may not be, so captured state may be stale when the
 * action is invoked.
 *
 * @param PropsT Typically a data class that is used to pass configuration information or bits of
 * state that the workflow can always get from its parent and needn't duplicate in its own state.
 * May be [Unit] if the workflow does not need any props data.
 *
 * @param StateT Typically a data class that contains all of the internal state for this workflow.
 * The state is seeded via [props][PropsT] in [initialState]. It can be [serialized][snapshotState]
 * and later used to restore the workflow. **Implementations of the `Workflow`
 * interface should not generally contain their own state directly.** They may inject objects like
 * instances of their child workflows, or network clients, but should not contain directly mutable
 * state. This is the only type parameter that a parent workflow needn't care about for its children,
 * and may just use star (`*`) instead of specifying it. May be [Unit] if the workflow does not have
 * any internal state (see [StatelessWorkflow]).
 *
 * @param OutputT Typically a sealed class that represents "events" that this workflow can send
 * to its parent.
 * May be [Nothing] if the workflow doesn't need to emit anything.
 *
 * @param RenderingT The value returned to this workflow's parent during [composition][render].
 * Typically represents a "view" of this workflow's props, current state, and children's renderings.
 * A workflow that represents a UI component may use a view model as its rendering type.
