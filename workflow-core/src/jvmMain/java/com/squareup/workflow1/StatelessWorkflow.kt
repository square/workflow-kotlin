 * Minimal implementation of [Workflow] that maintains no state of its own.
 *
 * @param PropsT Typically a data class that is used to pass configuration information or bits of
 * state that the workflow can always get from its parent and needn't duplicate in its own state.
 * May be [Unit] if the workflow does not need any props data.
 *
 * @param OutputT Typically a sealed class that represents "events" that this workflow can send
 * to its parent.
 * May be [Nothing] if the workflow doesn't need to emit anything.
 *
 * @param RenderingT The value returned to this workflow's parent during [composition][render].
 * Typically represents a "view" of this workflow's props, current state, and children's renderings.
 * A workflow that represents a UI component may use a view model as its rendering type.
