/**
 * The [Workflow] that implements the logic for actually running [Worker]s.
 *
 * This workflow is an [ImpostorWorkflow] and uses the entire [KType] of the [Worker] as its
 * [realIdentifier], so that the runtime can ensure that distinct worker types are allowed to run
 * concurrently. Implements [Worker.doesSameWorkAs] by taking the actual worker instance as its
 * props, and checking [Worker.doesSameWorkAs] in [onPropsChanged]. When this returns false, it
 * means a new worker session needs to be started, and that is achieved by storing a monotonically-
 * increasing integer as the state, and incrementing it whenever the worker needs to be restarted.
 *
 * Note that since this workflow uses an [unsnapshottableIdentifier] as its [realIdentifier], it is
 * not snapshottable, but that's fine because the only state this workflow maintains is only used
 * to determine whether to restart workers during the lifetime of a single runtime instance.
 *
 * @param workerType The [KType] representing the particular type of `Worker<OutputT>`.
 * @param key The key used to render this workflow, as passed to
 * [BaseRenderContext.runningWorker]. Used for naming the worker's coroutine.
