/**
 * Represents a [Workflow]'s "identity" and is used by the runtime to determine whether a workflow
 * is the same as one that was rendered in a previous render pass, in which case its state
 * should be re-used; or if it's a new workflow and needs to be started.
 *
 * A workflow's identity consists primarily of its concrete type (i.e. the class that implements
 * the [Workflow] interface). Two workflows of the same concrete type are considered identical.
 * However, if a workflow class implements [ImpostorWorkflow], the identifier will also include
 * that workflow's [ImpostorWorkflow.realIdentifier].
 *
 * Instances of this class are [equatable][equals] and [hashable][hashCode].
 *
 * ## Identifiers and snapshots
 *
 * Since workflows can be [serialized][StatefulWorkflow.snapshotState], workflows' identifiers must
 * also be serializable in order to match workflows back up with their snapshots when restoring.
 * However, some [WorkflowIdentifier]s may represent workflows that cannot be snapshotted. When an
 * identifier is not snapshottable, [toByteStringOrNull] will return null, and any identifiers that
 * reference [ImpostorWorkflow]s whose [ImpostorWorkflow.realIdentifier] is not snapshottable will
 * also not be snapshottable. Such identifiers are created with [unsnapshottableIdentifier], but
 * should not be used to wrap arbitrary workflows since those workflows may expect to be
 * snapshotted.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param type Wrapper around the [KClass] of the [Workflow] this identifier identifies, or the
 * [KType] of an [unsnapshottableIdentifier].
 * @param proxiedIdentifier An optional identifier from [ImpostorWorkflow.realIdentifier] that will
 * be used to further narrow the scope of this identifier.
 * @param description Implementation of [ImpostorWorkflow.describeRealIdentifier].
