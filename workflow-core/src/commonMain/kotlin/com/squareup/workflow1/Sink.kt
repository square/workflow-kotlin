 *     - `map` turns `Type<T>` into `Type<U>` via `(T)->U`.
 *     - `contraMap` turns `Type<T>` into `Type<U>` via `(U)->T`
 *
 * Another way to think about this is: `map` transforms a type by changing the
 * output types of its API, while `contraMap` transforms a type by changing the
 * *input* types of its API.

 * queued.
 *
 * This method is intended to be used from [BaseRenderContext.runningSideEffect].

 * Example:
 * ```

 *     action { setOutput(value) }
