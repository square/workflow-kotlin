 * @param checkRenderIdempotence If true, every render method will be called multiple times, to help
 * suss out any side effects that a render method is trying to perform. This parameter defaults to
 * `true` since the workflow contract is that `render` will be called an arbitrary number of times
 * for any given state, so performing side effects in `render` will almost always result in bugs.

 * deal with the extra passes, you can temporarily set it to false.
