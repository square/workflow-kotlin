/**
 * Implementation of [Worker] for integration tests (using [launchForTestingFromStartWith] or [launchForTestingFromStateWith]) that
 * need to simply push values into the worker from the test.
 *
 * Instances of this class are considered equivalent if they have matching [type] and [name].
 *
 * These workers can not be run concurrently â€“ they may only be run by a single workflow at a time,
 * although they may be run multiple times sequentially. The [Flow] returned by [run] will throw an
 * exception if it is collected more than once concurrently.
 *
 * @param name String used to distinguish this worker from other [WorkerSink]s being ran by the same
 * workflow. Used to implement [doesSameWorkAs], see the kdoc on that method for more information.
