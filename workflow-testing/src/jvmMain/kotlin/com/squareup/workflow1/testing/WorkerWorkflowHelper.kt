/**
 * If this [Workflow] is of type [WorkerWorkflow], defined in `workflow-core`, then returns the
 * value of the [WorkerWorkflow.workerType] property. The reason this is a separate function and in
 * its own file is that it relies on the kotlin compiler's friend paths to access the type.
 * Unfortunately, the IntelliJ Kotlin plugin has no knowledge of friend paths, so the IDE will
 * complain that this class and the property are inaccessible. This is wrong, and this code will
 * actually compile and work fine. It's in a separate file so that no other code is affected by this
 * false IDE compiler error.
 *
 * See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-20760.
