 * The props must be specified, the initial state may be specified, and then all child workflows

 * [expectWorkflow] and (optionally) [expectWorker] and [expectSideEffect] calls.
 * If one needs to verify all workers explicitly, perhaps to verify that a worker is *not* run,
 * then use [requireExplicitWorkerExpectations]. Likewise [requireExplicitSideEffectExpectations]
 * for side effects.
 * Then call [render] and perform any assertions on the rendering. An event may also be sent to the
 * rendering if no workflows or workers emitted an output. Lastly, the [RenderTestResult] returned
 * by `render` may be used to assert on the [WorkflowAction]s processed to handle events or outputs
 * by calling [verifyAction][RenderTestResult.verifyAction] or
 * [verifyActionResult][RenderTestResult.verifyActionResult].
 *
 * - All workflows that are rendered/ran by this workflow must be specified.
 * - Workers are optionally specified. Specified workers must run. Unexpected workers on a render
 *   pass do not cause a test failure unless [requireExplicitWorkerExpectations] is true.
 *   Side effects are optionally specified. Specified side effects must run. Unexpected side effects
 *   on a render pass do not cause a test failure unless [requireExplicitSideEffectExpectations] is
 *   true.
 * - It is an error if more than one workflow or worker specifies an output.
 * - It is a test failure if any workflows or workers that were expected were not ran.
 * - It is a test failure if the workflow tried to run any workflows that were not expected.
 * - It is a test failure if no workflow or worker emitted an output, no rendering event was
 *   invoked, and any of the action verification methods on [RenderTestResult] is called.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ### Worker output
 *
 * The following example tests a render pass that runs one worker, `SubmitLoginWorker`, which
 * is configured to have "emitted" an output, and one workflow, `ChildWorkflow`, which expects a
 * props containing "test@foo.com" and returning a `ChildRendering` as its rendering.
 *
 * It checks that the rendering properties are expected and that the output handler for the
 * `SubmitLoginWorker` returned the `CompleteLogin` action.
 *
 *    workflow
 *      .testRender(
 *        props = MyProps(…),
 *        initialState = MyState(…)
 *      )
 *      .expectWorker(
 *        workerClass = SubmitLoginWorker::class
 *        key = "signIn",
 *        output = WorkflowOutput(LoginResponse(success = true))
 *      )
 *      .expectWorkflow(
 *        workflowType = ChildWorkflow::class,
 *        key = "child",
 *        assertProps = { assertThat(it.email).isEqualTo("test@foo.com") },
 *        rendering = ChildRendering("message")
 *      )
 *      .render { rendering ->
 *        assertThat(rendering.text).isEqualTo("foo")
 *      }
 *      .verifyAction { action ->
 *        assertThat(action).isEqualTo(Action.CompleteLogin(success = true))
 *      }
 *
 * ### Rendering event
 *
 * This is similar to the example above, but will test an event sent to the rendering instead.
 *
 *    workflow
 *      .testRender(
 *        props = MyProps(…),
 *        initialState = MyState(…)
 *      )
 *      .expectWorker(
 *        matchesWhen = { it is SubmitLoginWorker },
 *        key = "signIn"
 *      )
 *      .expectWorkflow(
 *        workflowType = ChildWorkflow::class,
 *        key = "child",
 *        assertProps = { assertThat(it.email).isEqualTo("test@foo.com") },
 *        rendering = ChildRendering("message")
 *      )
 *      .render { rendering ->
 *        rendering.onCancelClicked()
 *        assertThat(rendering.text).isEqualTo("foo")
 *      }
 *      .verifyAction { action ->
 *        assertThat(action).isEqualTo(Action.CancelLogin)
 *      }
 *
 * ### Verify action result
 *
 * This test verifies the action _result_ instead of the action itself. This technique is useful
 * if the [WorkflowAction] is anonymous or inline.
 *
 *    val currentState = …
 *    val previousState = …
 *
 *    workflow
 *      .testRender(
 *        props = MyProps(…),
 *        initialState = currentState
 *      )
 *      .render { rendering ->
 *        rendering.onCancelClicked()
 *      }
 *      .verifyActionResult { newState, output ->
 *        // Check that the workflow navigated back correctly.
 *        assertThat(newState).isEqualTo(previousState)
 *
 *        // Check that the workflow didn't emit any output from the button click.
 *        assertThat(output).isNull()
 *      }
 *
 * ### Too many outputs
 *
 * This is an example of what **not** to do – this test will error out because a worker is emitting
 * and output _and_ a rendering event is sent.
 *
 *    workflow
 *      .testRender(
 *        props = MyProps(…),
 *        initialState = MyState(…)
 *      )
 *      .expectWorker(
 *        matchesWhen = { it is SubmitLoginWorker },
 *        key = "signIn",
 *        output = WorkflowOutput(LoginResponse(success = true))
 *      )
 *      .expectWorkflow(
 *        workflowType = ChildWorkflow::class,
 *        key = "child",
 *        assertProps = { assertThat(it.email).isEqualTo("test@foo.com") },
 *        rendering = ChildRendering("message")
 *      )
 *      .render { rendering ->
 *        // This will throw and fail the test because the SubmitLoginWorker is also configured to emit
 *        // an output.
 *        rendering.onCancelClicked()

/**
 * @see [expectWorkflow] for more on this expectation.
 *
 * This is a special use version for when the only reasonable [KClass] you have to verify against
 * is the definition of a workflow whose [OutputT] and [RenderingT] are supertypes of the [OutputT]
 * and [RenderingT] of the child workflow type you expect to be rendered.
 * In other words, the expected workflow is covariant with the class you have to pass to the
 * expectation. (There is a slight nuance here, in that if the [OutputT] is a supertype of the
 * expected child's [OutputT], then those workflow's are not actually covariant since [OutputT]
 * is an invariant generic type. This is not important for the use of this expectation, however.)
 *
 * The most common need for this is when you are using a generic factory to construct Workflow
 * instances that you then wish to expect in your test.
 *
 * In that case, use this expectation and provide the [KClass] of the Workflow type, along with the
 * [KType] of the [OutputT] and [RenderingT]. The [PropsT] can simply be verified for type safety
 * inside [assertProps] by casting the [Any?] into the expected [PropsT].
 *
 * Note that this implementation does not handle [ImpostorWorkflow][com.squareup.workflow1.ImpostorWorkflow]s
 * (for proxied identifiers) like the other versions do.
 *
 * @param childWorkflowClass The [KClass] of the expected workflow or one of its supertypes,
 * including covariant supertypes. E.g. if the workflow type is an interface and the
 * workflow-under-test injects a fake.
 *
 * @param childOutputType The [KType] of the [OutputT] of the expected child workflow.
 *
 * @param outputTypeVerificationLevel The number of 'levels' of generic arguments to verify in
 * the [OutputT], e.g., for `Wrapper<*>` and level 1 only `Wrapper` would be checked, whereas for
 * level 2, `Wrapper` and `*` (the star projection) would be checked against the
 * [RenderChildInvocation].
 *
 * @param childRenderingType The [KType] of the [RenderingT] of the expected child workflow.
 *
 * @param renderingTypeVerificationLevel The number of 'levels' of generic arguments to verify in
 * the [OutputT], e.g., for `Wrapper<*>` and level 1 only `Wrapper` would be checked, whereas for
 * level 2, `Wrapper` and `*` (the star projection) would be checked against the
 * [RenderChildInvocation].
 *
 * @param rendering The rendering to return from
 * [renderChild][com.squareup.workflow1.BaseRenderContext.renderChild] when this workflow is
 * rendered.
 *
 * @param key The key passed to [renderChild][com.squareup.workflow1.BaseRenderContext.renderChild]
 * when rendering this workflow.
 *
 * @param assertProps A function that performs assertions on the props passed to
 * [renderChild][com.squareup.workflow1.BaseRenderContext.renderChild].
 *
 * @param output If non-null, [WorkflowOutput.value] will be "emitted" when this workflow is
 * rendered. The [WorkflowAction] used to handle this output can be verified using methods on
 * [RenderTestResult].
 *
 * @param description Optional string that will be used to describe this expectation in error
 * messages.
