/**
 * Version of [PoemsBrowserWorkflow] that takes in a [SimulatedPerfConfig] to control the
 * performance behavior of the Workflow.
 *
 * @param [simulatedPerfConfig] specifies whether to make the Workflow more 'complex' by
 * introducing some asynchronous delays. See [SimulatedPerfConfig] for more details.
 *
 * @param [isLoading] will be set to true while this workflow is 'loading'. This is so that another
 * component, such as a [MaybeLoadingGatekeeperWorkflow] can overlay the screen with a visual
 * loading state. N.B. that whether or not this is loading could be included in the
 * RenderingT if the interface [PoemsBrowserWorkflow] had been left more flexible.
 *
 * ** Also note that raw mutable state sharing like this will almost always be a smell. It would
 * be better to inject an interface of a 'Loading' service that could trigger this and likely
 * break ties/conflicts with a token in the start/stop requests. We leave that complexity out
 * here. **
