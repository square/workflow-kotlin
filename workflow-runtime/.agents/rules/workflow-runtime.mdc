# Workflow Runtime Guidelines

- Use `renderWorkflowIn` to start a workflow runtime and obtain renderings.
- Tie the runtime scope to a lifecycle or coroutine scope that will be cancelled.
- Use `RuntimeConfig` to customize runtime behavior when needed.
- Avoid side effects in `render()`; use `runningWorker` or `runningSideEffect`.
- Prefer `eventHandler("name")` for stable UI event callbacks.
