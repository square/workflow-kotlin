        //   // Note 1: We do the check-and-yield after the walk up and down the workflow tree
        //   // intentionally. If there are multiple ComposeWorkflows in the tree, they could invalidate
        //   // themselves during the action cascade and call sendApplyNotifications after our call above.
        //   // However, since our call was first, it will have scheduled our compose runtime before
        //   // theirs. By doing the check after this potential situation, the top-most ComposeWorkflowNode
        //   // (CWN) will yield to its compose runtime first, but everything below it will have been
        //   // scheduled first, so a single suspending receive call allows all compose runtimes in the
        //   // tree to make their frame requests before resuming the walk back down the tree on return.

        //   // a frame request to be enqueued (withFrameNanos) and there is only one code path calling
