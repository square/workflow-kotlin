/**
 * Responsible for tracking child workflows, starting them and tearing them down when necessary.
 * Also manages restoring children from snapshots.
 *
 * Child workflows are stored in [WorkflowChildNode]s, which associate the child's [WorkflowNode]
 * with its output handler.
 *
 * ## Rendering
 *
 * This class implements [RealRenderContext.Renderer], and [WorkflowNode] will pass its instance
 * of this class to the [RealRenderContext] on each render pass to render children. That means that
 * when a workflow renders a child, this class does the actual work.
 *
 * This class keeps two lists:
 *  1. Active list: All the children from the last render pass that have not yet been rendered in
 *     the subsequent pass.
 *  2. Staging list: Children that have been rendered in the current render pass, before the pass is
 *     [committed][commitRenderedChildren].
 *
 * The render process is as follows:
 *   1. When the render pass starts, the staging list is empty and the active list contains all the
 *      children rendered in the last pass.
 *      ```
 *      active:  [foo, bar]
 *      staging: []
 *      ```
 *   2. Every time a child is rendered, it is looked up in the list of children from the last render
 *      pass. If found, it is removed from the active list and added to the staging list.
 *      ```
 *      render(foo)
 *      active:  [bar]
 *      staging: [foo]
 *      ```
 *   3. If not found, a new [WorkflowChildNode] is created and added to the staging list.
 *      ```
 *      render(baz)
 *      active:  [bar]
 *      staging: [foo, baz]
 *      ```
 *   4. When the workflow's render method returns, the [WorkflowNode] calls
 *      [commitRenderedChildren], which:
 *        1. Tears down all the children remaining in the active list
 *           ```
 *           bar.cancel()
 *           active:  [bar]
 *           staging: [foo, baz]
 *           ```
 *        2. Clears the old active list
 *           ```
 *           active:  []
 *           staging: [foo, baz]
 *           ```
 *        3. And then swaps the active and staging lists.
 *           ```
 *           active:  [foo, baz]
 *           staging: []
 *           ```
 *      This just updates a couple references, and since the lists are swapped, doesn't involve any
 *      allocations.
 *
 * When looking up a child in the active list, a linear search is used. This is expected to perform
 * adequately in practice because most workflows don't have a large number of children (even as few
 * as ten is uncommon), and in the most common case, the structure of the workflow tree doesn't
 * change (no workflows are added or removed), and children are re-rendered in the same order as
 * before, so the first active child will usually match.
 *
 * @param snapshotCache When this manager's node is restored from a snapshot, its children
 * snapshots are extracted into this cache. Then, when those children are started for the
 * first time, they are also restored from their snapshots.
