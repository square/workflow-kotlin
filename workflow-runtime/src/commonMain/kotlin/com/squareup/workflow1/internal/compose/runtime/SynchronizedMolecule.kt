/**
 * A self-contained Compose runtime (like Molecule) that is driven by explicitly telling it when to
 * recompose.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Create an instance of this interface by calling [launchSynchronizedMolecule] and passing the
 * [CoroutineScope] used to run recomposition and effects, as well as a function to schedule
 * a call to [recomposeWithContent] when composition state is changed. When you're ready to
 * compose the initial content, call [recomposeWithContent]: this will compose the composable passed
 * to it and the compose runtime will start observing state changes. When state is changed, the
 * scheduling function passed to [launchSynchronizedMolecule] will be called, but the composition
 * will not be recomposed until [recomposeWithContent] is called again. The scheduling function will
 * never be called more than once before the next call to [recomposeWithContent].
 *
 * To check if composition state has changed imperatively, check [needsRecomposition].
 *
 * To stop observing state changes, either cancel the [CoroutineScope] or call
 * [SynchronizedMolecule.close].
 *
 * ## Implementation and runtime behavior
 *
 * The compose runtime is driven by an instance of [Recomposer] that runs the recomposition loop
 * in a coroutine, scheduling recompositions via a [MonotonicFrameClock]. When compose snapshot
 * state is changed, the recomposer eventually gets notified about the changes, which resumes an
 * internal suspending loop, and eventually requests a frame from its frame clock.
 *
 * This class helps out by collapsing some of those steps: As soon as snapshot apply notifications
 * have been sent this class will immediately make the frame request available, even if the
 * underlying dispatcher wouldn't have normally resumed the recompose loop in time to make the frame
 * request. It does this by running the recompose loop on a special dispatcher that wraps the
 * underlying dispatcher but allows us to explicitly advance for the recompose loop, and by
 * advancing it any time the recomposer reports pending work but hasn't
 * requested a frame yet.
