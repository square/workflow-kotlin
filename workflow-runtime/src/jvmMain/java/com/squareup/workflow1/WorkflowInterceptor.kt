/**
 * Provides hooks into the workflow runtime that can be used to instrument or modify the behavior
 * of workflows.
 *
 * This interface's methods mirror the methods of [StatefulWorkflow]. It also has one additional
 * method, [onSessionStarted], that is notified when a workflow is started. Each method returns the
 * same thing as the corresponding method on [StatefulWorkflow], and receives the same parameters
 * as well as two extra parameters:
 *
 *  - **`proceed`** – A function that _exactly_ mirrors the corresponding function on
 *    [StatefulWorkflow], accepting the same parameters and returning the same thing. An interceptor
 *    can call this function to run the actual workflow, but it may also decide to not call it at
 *    all, or call it multiple times.
 *  - **`session`** – A [WorkflowSession] object that can be queried for information about the
 *    workflow being intercepted. Note that this object carries [parent][WorkflowSession.parent]
 *    information. So we can use the session object to determine if we are the root Workflow if
 *    session.parent == null.
 *
 * All methods have default no-op implementations.
 *
 * ## On Profiling
 *
 * Note that the [WorkflowInterceptor]'s methods will call the actual methods with the proceed
 * function. This means that we have hooks before and after the actual method making it very
 * straightforward to trace/measure the timing of any part of any workflow, or of the whole
 * tree.
 *
 * ## Workflow sessions
 *
 * A single workflow may be rendered by different parents at the same time, or the same parent at
 * different, disjoint times. Each continuous sequence of renderings of a particular workflow type,
 * with the same key passed to [BaseRenderContext.renderChild], is called a "session" of that
 * workflow. The workflow's [StatefulWorkflow.initialState] method will be called at the start of
 * the session, and its state will be maintained by the runtime until the session is finished.
 * Each session is identified by the [WorkflowSession] object passed into the corresponding method
 * in a [WorkflowInterceptor].
 *
 * In addition to the [WorkflowIdentifier] of the type of the workflow being rendered, this object
 * also knows the [key][WorkflowSession.renderKey] used to render the workflow and the
 * [WorkflowSession] of the [parent][WorkflowSession.parent] workflow that is rendering it.
 *
 * Each session is also assigned a numerical ID that uniquely identifies the session over the
 * life of the entire runtime. This value will remain constant as long as the workflow's parent is
 * rendering it, and then it will never be used again. If this workflow stops being rendered, and
 * then starts again, the value will be different.
