   *
   * # Examples
   *
   * The backstack is represented by _nesting_ `showWorkflow` calls. Consider this example:
   * ```
   * backStackWorkflow {
   *   showWorkflow(child1) {
   *     showWorkflow(child2) {
   *       showWorkflow(child3) {
   *         // goBack()
   *       }
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * This eventually represents a backstack of `[child1, child2, child3]`. `child2` will be pushed
   * onto the stack when `child1` emits an output, and `child3` pushed when `child2` emits. The
   * lambdas for `child2` and `child3` can call `goBack` to pop the stack and cancel the lambdas that
   * called their `showWorkflow`, until the next output is emitted.
   *
   * Contrast with calls in series:
   * ```
   * backStackWorkflow {
   *   showWorkflow(child1) { finishWith(Unit) }
   *   showWorkflow(child2) { finishWith(Unit) }
   *   showWorkflow(child3) { }
   * }
   * ```
   * `child1` will be shown immediately, but when it emits an output, instead of pushing `child2` onto
   * the stack, `child1` will be removed from the stack and replaced with `child2`.
   *
   * These can be combined:
   * ```
   * backStackWorkflow {
   *   showWorkflow(child1) {
   *     showWorkflow(child2) {
   *       // goBack(), or
   *       finishWith(Unit)
   *     }
   *     showWorkflow(child3) {
   *       // goBack()
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * This code will show `child1` immediately, then when it emits an output show `child2`. When
   * `child2` emits an output, it can decide to call `goBack` to show `child1` again, or call
   * `finishWith` to replace itself with `child3`. `child3` can also call `goBack` to show `child`
   * again.
