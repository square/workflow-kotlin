# Tutorial

## Overview

Oh hi! Looks like you want build some software with Workflows! It's a bit different from traditional
Android development, so let's go through building a simple little TODO app to get the basics down.

## Layout

The project has both a starting point, as well as an example of the completed tutorial.

To help with the setup, we have created a few helpers:

- `tutorial-views`: A set of 3 views for the 3 screens we will be building, `Welcome`, `TodoList`,
  and `TodoEdit`.
- `tutorial-base`: This is the starting point to build out the tutorial. It contains view
  controllers that host the views from `TutorialViews` to see how they display.
- `tutorial-final`: This is an example of the completed tutorial - could be used as a reference if
  you get stuck.

## Getting started

To get set up, launch Android Studio and open the `samples/tutorial` folder.

## Tutorial Steps

- [Tutorial 1](Tutorial1.md) - Single view backed by a workflow
- [Tutorial 2](Tutorial2.md) - Multiple views and navigation
- [Tutorial 3](Tutorial3.md) - State throughout a tree of workflows
- [Tutorial 4](Tutorial4.md) - Refactoring
- [Tutorial 5](Tutorial5.md) - Testing
