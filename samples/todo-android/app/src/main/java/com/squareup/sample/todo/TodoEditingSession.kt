/**
 * An Android compatible editing session for a [TodoList]. Provides
 * a [TextController] for a list's [title][TodoList.title], and
 * for each of its [entries][TodoList.entries].
 *
 * Serves as the state of [TodoEditorWorkflow], and also as part of
 * its rendering type, [TodoEditorScreen]. The workflow tracks updates via
 * [TextController.onTextChanged], and view code can drive
 * [EditText][android.widget.EditText] instances with [TextController.control].
 *
 * Allowing view state and workflow state to bleed together like this is
 * not a great practice generally, but keeping up with live text editing
 * isâ€¦hard. So, for such use cases, using [TextController] in this style
 * _is_ recommended.
