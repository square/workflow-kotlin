/**
 * A stateless [Workflow] that [renders][RenderingContent] itself as a [Composable] function.
 * Effectively defines an inline [ComposeScreen].
 *
 * This workflow does not have access to a [RenderContext] since render contexts are only valid
 * during render passes, and this workflow's [RenderingContent] method is invoked after the render
 * pass, when view bindings are being shown.
 *
 * While this workflow is "stateless" in the usual workflow sense (it doesn't have a `StateT` type),
 * since [RenderingContent] is a Composable function, it can use all the usual Compose facilities
 * for state management.
 *
 * # CAVEAT
 *
 * We don't know if this is a useful/helpful pattern, or a pattern that will be confusing and cause
 * trouble. However, it seems interesting, so we wanted to be able to point to it if a use case
 * comes up.
