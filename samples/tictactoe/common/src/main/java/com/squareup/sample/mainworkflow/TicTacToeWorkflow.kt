/**
 * Application specific root [Workflow], and demonstration of workflow composition.
 * We log in, and then play as many games as we want.
 *
 * Delegates to [AuthWorkflow] and [RunGameWorkflow]. Responsible only for deciding
 * what to do as each nested workflow ends.
 *
 * Note how we normalize the rendering types of the two children. In particular:
 *
 * - We put the [BackStackScreen] from the [AuthWorkflow] into a [PanelOverlay], along
 *   with any [namePrompt][com.squareup.sample.gameworkflow.RunGameRendering.namePrompt]
 *   from [RunGameWorkflow]
 * - We add a [ScrimScreen] over our base to get the desired visual treatment under
 *   the [PanelOverlay]
 *
 * A [Unit] output event is emitted to signal that the workflow has ended, and the host
 * activity should be finished.
