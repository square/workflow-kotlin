/**
 * Application specific root [Workflow], and demonstration of workflow composition.
 * We log in, and then play as many games as we want.
 *
 * Delegates to [AuthWorkflow] and [RealRunGameWorkflow]. Responsible only for deciding
 * what to do as each nested workflow ends.
 *
 * We adopt [RunGameScreen] as our own rendering type because it's more demanding
 * than that of [AuthWorkflow]. We normalize the latter to be consistent
 * with the former.
 *
 * A [Unit] output event is emitted to signal that the workflow has ended, and the host
 * activity should be finished.
