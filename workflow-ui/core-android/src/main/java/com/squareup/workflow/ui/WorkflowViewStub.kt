/**
 * A placeholder [View] that can replace itself with ones driven by workflow renderings,
 * similar to [android.view.ViewStub]. Unlike [android.view.ViewStub], it will set the
 * id declared on the stub onto the view that replaces the stub.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * In the XML layout for a container view, place a [WorkflowViewStub] where
 * you want child renderings to be displayed. E.g.:
 *
 *    <LinearLayout…>
 *
 *        <com.squareup.workflow.ui.WorkflowViewStub
 *            android:id="@+id/child_stub"
 *            />
 *       …
 *
 * Then in your [LayoutRunner],
 *   - pull the view out with `findViewById` like any other view
 *   - and update it in your `showRendering` method:
 *
 * ```
 *     class YourLayoutRunner(view: View) {
 *       private val child = view.findViewById<WorkflowViewStub>(R.id.child_stub)
 *
 *       override fun showRendering(
 *          rendering: YourRendering,
 *          viewEnvironment: ViewEnvironment
 *       ) {
 *         child.update(rendering.childRendering, viewEnvironment)
 *       }
 *     }
 * ```
