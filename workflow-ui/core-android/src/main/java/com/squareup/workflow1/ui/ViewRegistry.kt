/**
 * The [ViewEnvironment] service that can be used to display the stream of renderings
 * from a workflow tree as [View] instances. This is the engine behind [AndroidViewRendering],
 * [WorkflowViewStub] and [ViewFactory]. Most apps can ignore [ViewRegistry] as an implementation
 * detail, by using [AndroidViewRendering] to tie their rendering classes to view code.
 *
 * To avoid that coupling between workflow code and the Android runtime, registries can
 * be loaded with [ViewFactory] instances at runtime, and provided as an optional parameter to
 * [WorkflowLayout.start].
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *     val AuthViewFactories = ViewRegistry(
 *       AuthorizingLayoutRunner, LoginLayoutRunner, SecondFactorLayoutRunner
 *     )
 *
 *     val TicTacToeViewFactories = ViewRegistry(
 *       NewGameLayoutRunner, GamePlayLayoutRunner, GameOverLayoutRunner
 *     )
 *
 *     val ApplicationViewFactories = ViewRegistry(ApplicationLayoutRunner) +
 *       AuthViewFactories + TicTacToeViewFactories
 *
 *     override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
 *       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
 *
 *       val model: MyViewModel by viewModels()
 *       setContentView(
 *         WorkflowLayout(this).apply { start(model.renderings, ApplicationViewFactories) }
 *       )
 *     }
 *
 *     /** As always, use an androidx ViewModel for state that survives config change. */
 *     class MyViewModel(savedState: SavedStateHandle) : ViewModel() {
 *       val renderings: StateFlow<Any> by lazy {
 *         renderWorkflowIn(
 *           workflow = rootWorkflow,
 *           scope = viewModelScope,
 *           savedStateHandle = savedState
 *         )
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * In the above example, it is assumed that the `companion object`s of the various
 * decoupled [LayoutRunner] classes honor a convention of implementing [ViewFactory], in
 * aid of this kind of assembly.
 *
 *     class GamePlayLayoutRunner(view: View) : LayoutRunner<GameRendering> {
 *
 *       // ...
 *
 *       companion object : ViewFactory<GameRendering> by LayoutRunner.bind(
 *         R.layout.game_layout, ::GameLayoutRunner
 *       )
