/**
 * Does the bulk of the work of maintaining a set of [Dialog][android.app.Dialog]s
 * to reflect lists of [Overlay]. Can be used to create custom [Overlay]-based
 * layouts if [BodyAndOverlaysScreen] or the default [BodyAndOverlaysContainer] bound
 * to it are too restrictive.
 *
 * - Provides an [allowEvents] field that reflects the presence or absence of Dialogs driven
 *   by [ModalOverlay]
 *
 * - Makes [OverlayArea] available in the [ViewEnvironment],
 *   and uses it to drive calls to [OverlayDialogHolder.onUpdateBounds].
 *
 * - Provides a [ViewTreeLifecycleOwner] per managed Dialog, and view persistence support,
 *   both for classic [View.onSaveInstanceState] and
 *   Jetpack [SavedStateRegistry][androidx.savedstate.SavedStateRegistry].
 *
 * ## Lifecycle of a managed [Dialog][android.app.Dialog]
 *
 * When [update] is called with an [Overlay] that is not [Compatible] with an
 * existing Dialog at the same index, the appropriate [OverlayDialogFactory] instance
 * is fetched from the [ViewEnvironment]. That factory builds (but does not
 * [show][android.app.Dialog.show]) a new Dialog, wrapped in an [OverlayDialogHolder].
 * The holder in turn is held by a [DialogSession] instance. There is a 1:1:1 relationship
 * between the Dialog, the [OverlayDialogHolder] which can [update it][OverlayDialogHolder.show],
 * and the [DialogSession] that manages its [LifecycleOwner] and persistence.
 *
 * When a new [DialogSession] begins:
 *
 * - a [ViewTreeLifecycleOwner] is created as a child to the one provided
 *   by [getParentLifecycleOwner]
 *
 * - An appropriately scoped [SavedStateRegistry][androidx.savedstate.SavedStateRegistry]
 *   is put in place, provided that [onAttachedToWindow] and [onDetachedFromWindow] are
 *   called from the like named methods of the nearest container View
 *
 * - Any available classic View state is restored to the new Dialog's content View tree,
 *   provided that [onSaveInstanceState] and [onRestoreInstanceState] are called from the
 *   like named methods of that container View
 *
 * - And the Dialog is [shown][android.app.Dialog.show]
 *
 * The [DialogSession] is maintained (and its two flavors of View state are recorded
 * as prompted by the Android runtime) so long as [update] is called with a
 * [Compatible] [Overlay] rendering in the same position.
 *
 * When [update] is called without a matching [Overlay], or the
 * [parent Lifecycle][getParentLifecycleOwner] ends, the [DialogSession] ends,
 * its [ViewTreeLifecycleOwner] is destroyed, and the Dialog is
 * [dismissed][android.app.Dialog.dismiss].
 *
 * @param bounds made available to managed dialogs via the [OverlayArea]
 * [ViewEnvironmentKey][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.ViewEnvironmentKey],
 * which drives [OverlayDialogHolder.onUpdateBounds].
 *
 * @param cancelEvents function to be called when a modal session starts -- that is,
 * when [update] is first called with a [ModalOverlay] member, or called again with
 * one after calls with none.
 *
 * @param getParentLifecycleOwner provides the [LifecycleOwner] to serve as
 * an ancestor to those created for managed [Dialog][android.app.Dialog]s.
