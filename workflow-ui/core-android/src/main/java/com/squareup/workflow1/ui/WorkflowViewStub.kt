/**
 * A placeholder [View] that can replace itself with ones driven by workflow renderings,
 * similar to [android.view.ViewStub].
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * In the XML layout for a container view, place a [WorkflowViewStub] where
 * you want child renderings to be displayed. E.g.:
 *
 *    <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
 *         xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
 *         …>
 *
 *        <com.squareup.workflow1.WorkflowViewStub
 *            android:id="@+id/child_stub"
 *            app:inflatedId="@+id/child"
 *            />
 *       …
 *
 * Then in your [LayoutRunner],
 *   - pull the view out with [findViewById] like any other view
 *   - and [update] it in your [LayoutRunner.showRendering] method:
 *
 * ```
 *     class YourLayoutRunner(view: View) {
 *       private val childStub = view.findViewById<WorkflowViewStub>(R.id.child_stub)
 *
 *       // Totally optional, since this view is also accessible as [childStub.actual].
 *       // Note that R.id.child was set in XML via the square:inflatedId parameter.
 *       private val child: View by lazy {
 *         view.findViewById<View>(R.id.child)
 *       }
 *
 *       override fun showRendering(
 *          rendering: YourRendering,
 *          viewEnvironment: ViewEnvironment
 *       ) {
 *         childStub.update(rendering.childRendering, viewEnvironment)
 *       }
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * **NB**: If you're using a stub in a `RelativeLayout` or `ConstraintLayout`, relationships
 * should be tied to the stub's `app:inflatedId`, not its `android:id`.
 *
 * Use [updatesVisibility] and [setBackground] for more control of how [update]
 * effects the visibility and backgrounds of created views.
 *
 * Use [replaceOldViewInParent] to customize replacing [actual] with a new view, e.g.
 * for animated transitions.
