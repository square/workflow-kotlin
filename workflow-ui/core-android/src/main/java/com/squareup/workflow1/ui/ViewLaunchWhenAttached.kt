/**
 * Launches a coroutine when the view is attached, and cancels it when detached. The [block] is passed
 * the current [CoroutineScope] as its receiver.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Use this if you need to do scoped work while a view is attached, for example update the UI with an
 * expensive-to-compute image at regular intervals. Don’t use this if you expect the work to continue /
 * not be interrupted after a configuration change that lands on the same screen (e.g. for network
 * calls).
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * If the view is attached when this function is called, the coroutine will be started synchronously
 * with the [CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED] mode, which means the suspend block will execute until its
 * first suspension point. If the view is not attached when this function is called, the [block] will
 * be queued to be executed as soon as the view is attached.
 *
 * When the view becomes detached (regardless of its initial attach state), the [CoroutineScope] that
 * the [block] is running in will be canceled. The scope will remain cancelled _even if the view is
 * later reattached_. The [block] _will not_ be re-started if the view is re-attached.
 *
 * The coroutine will be a child of the scope of the receiver's
 * [LifecycleOwner][findViewTreeLifecycleOwner].
 *
 * @param context The [CoroutineContext] in which to run the returned [CoroutineScope].
 * This context _must not_ contain a [Job] – if it does, an [IllegalArgumentException]
 * will be thrown.
 *
 * @return The [Job] that will be cancelled when the view is detached. The job hierarchy created by
 * this function is: `ViewTreeLifecycleOwner -> returned Job -> launched coroutine block`
 * (where `->` means "is the parent of"). Both the returned job and the launched coroutine
 * will be cancelled if the `ViewTreeLifecycleOwner` ends. If the returned job is cancelled,
 * the launched coroutine will be cancelled. The returned job is meant to provide a way to
 * cancel the launched coroutine before the view is detached.
