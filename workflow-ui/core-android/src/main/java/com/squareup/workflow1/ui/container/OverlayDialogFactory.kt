/**
 * Factory for [Dialog] instances that can show renderings of type [OverlayT].
 * Most easily implemented using the [ScreenOverlay] interface to define the
 * [Dialog] `contentView`, and calling the [asDialogHolderWithContent]
 * extension function to set it.
 *
 * To really minimize boilerplate, have your rendering classes implement [AndroidOverlay] to
 * directly associate them with an appropriate [OverlayDialogFactory].
 *
 * e.g., this is all that is required to define a new style of dialog ready for use
 * in the [overlays][BodyAndOverlaysScreen.overlays] list of [BodyAndOverlaysScreen]:
 *
 *    data class MyFancyModal<C: Screen>(
 *      override val content: C
 *    ): ScreenOverlay<C>, ModalOverlay, AndroidOverlay<MyFancyModal<C>> {
 *      override fun <D : Screen> map(transform: (C) -> D) = MyFancyModal(transform(content))
 *
 *      override val dialogFactory = OverlayDialogFactory<MyFancyModal<C>> { r, e, c ->
 *        AppCompatDialog(c).asDialogHolderWithContent(r, e)
 *      }
 *    }
 *
 * For more flexibility, and to avoid coupling your workflow directly to the Android runtime,
 * see [ViewRegistry].
 *
 * ## Details of [Dialog] management
 *
 * There is a lot of machinery provided to give control over the placement of
 * [Dialog] windows, and to ensure that [ModalOverlay] dialogs behave as expected (i.e.,
 * that events in the Activity window are blocked the instant a modal [Dialog] is shown).
 *
 * To support the bounds restricting behavior described in the kdoc of [BodyAndOverlaysScreen]
 * we provide an [OverlayArea] value in the [ViewEnvironment], which holds
 * the bounds of the view created to display the [BodyAndOverlaysScreen.body].
 * Well behaved dialogs created to display members of [BodyAndOverlaysScreen.overlays]
 * restrict themselves to those limits.
 *
 * Another [ViewEnvironment] value is maintained to support modality: [CoveredByModal].
 * When this value is true, it indicates that a dialog window driven by a [ModalOverlay]
 * is in play over the view, or is about to be, and so touch and click events should be
 * ignored. This is necessary because there is a long period after a call to
 * [Dialog.show][android.app.Dialog.show] before the new Dialog window will start
 * intercepting events -- an issue that has preoccupied Square for a
 * [very long time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2886407/dealing-with-rapid-tapping-on-buttons).)
 * The default container view driven by [BodyAndOverlaysScreen] automatically honors
 * [CoveredByModal].
 *
 * All of this is driven by the [LayeredDialogSessions] support class, which can also be used to
 * create custom [BodyAndOverlaysScreen] container views. To put such a custom container
 * in play, see [OverlayDialogFactoryFinder].
 *
 * It is important to note that the modal behavior described here is all keyed to the
 * [ModalOverlay] interface, not its parent type [Overlay]. Rendering types that declare the
 * latter but not the former can be used to create dialogs for non-modal windows like toasts
 * and tool tips.
