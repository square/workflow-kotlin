/**
 * A [ViewRegistry] that contains only other registries and delegates to their [buildView] methods.
 *
 * Whenever any registries are combined using the [ViewRegistry] factory functions or `plus`
 * operators, an instance of this class is returned. All registries' keys are checked at
 * construction to ensure that no duplicate keys exist.
 *
 * The implementation of [buildView] consists of a single layer of indirection â€“ the responsible
 * [ViewRegistry] is looked up in a map by key, and then that registry's [buildView] is called.
 *
 * When multiple [CompositeViewRegistry]s are combined, they are flattened, so that there is never
 * more than one layer of indirection. In other words, a [CompositeViewRegistry] will never contain
 * a reference to another [CompositeViewRegistry].
