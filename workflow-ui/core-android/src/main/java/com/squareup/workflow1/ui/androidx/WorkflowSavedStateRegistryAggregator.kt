/**
 * Manages a group of [SavedStateRegistryOwner]s that are all saved to
 * and restored from a single "parent" [SavedStateRegistryOwner]. [SavedStateRegistryOwner]
 * is the new androidx alternative to the [View.onSaveInstanceState] system, and
 * is required by Compose UI.
 *
 * This class is designed to support a navigation container view that owns a
 * a set of navigation "frames", where a frame is something that can be navigated
 * to/from. A frame loosely consists of a root [View] and its
 * [SavedStateRegistryOwner]. For example:
 *
 *  - a back stack container view will own an instance of [WorkflowSavedStateRegistryAggregator],
 *   and use it to assign a [SavedStateRegistryOwner] for its top view.
 *
 *  - a container view managing a set of windows will own an instance of
 *   [WorkflowSavedStateRegistryAggregator], and use it to assign a [SavedStateRegistryOwner]
 *   to each dialog's content view.
 *
 * Note that a [SavedStateRegistryOwner] works _in parallel_ to a
 * [LifecycleOwner][androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner].
 * Use [WorkflowLifecycleOwner] to ensure one is properly installed.
 *
 * [attachToParentRegistry] must be called when the container view is attached to a window,
 * and passed the parent registry. [detachFromParentRegistry] must be called when the
 * container view is detached.
 *
 * Call [installChildRegistryOwnerOn] to put a [SavedStateRegistryOwner]
 * in place on each managed child view, _before it is attached to a window_. After that:
 *
 *  - call [saveAndPruneChildRegistryOwner] if the child is removed from service but may
 *   be restored before [detachFromParentRegistry] is called (as when a back stack
 *   pushes and pops)
 *
 *  - call [pruneAllChildRegistryOwnersExcept] when views are permanently removed from service, taking care
 *   to identify the set that remain active
 *
 * Note that this class _does not_ offer support for the pre-Jetpack [View.onSaveInstanceState]
 * mechanism. Container views must handle that themselves.
