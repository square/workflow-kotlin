/**
 * A [ViewRegistry.Entry] that can build Android [View] instances, along with functions that can
 * update them to display [Screen] renderings of a particular [type], bundled together in instances
 * of [ScreenViewHolder].
 *
 * Use [fromLayout], [fromViewBinding], etc., to create a [ScreenViewFactory]. These helper methods
 * take a layout resource, view binding, or view building function as arguments, along with a
 * factory to create a [ScreenViewRunner.showRendering] function.
 *
 * It is rare to call [buildView] directly. Instead the most common path is to pass [Screen]
 * instances to [WorkflowViewStub.show], which will apply the [ScreenViewFactory] machinery for you.
 *
 * If you are building a custom container and for some reason can't delegate to
 * [WorkflowViewStub], here is how to do the work yourself:
 *
 * - Call [Screen.toViewFactory], which uses the [ScreenViewFactoryFinder] in the
 *   given [ViewEnvironment] to return the [ScreenViewFactory] bound to the type
 *   of the receiving [Screen].
 *
 * - Call [ScreenViewFactory.buildView] to build a view wrapped in the [ScreenViewHolder]
 *   that manages it.
 *
 * - Call [ScreenViewHolder.startShowing] to initialize the new view with its
 *   first [Screen] rendering, taking care to include a [ViewStarter] lambda that invokes
 *   [WorkflowLifecycleOwner.installOn][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.androidx.WorkflowLifecycleOwner.installOn]
 *
 * - On subsequent updates, if [ScreenViewHolder.canShow] returns true, call [ScreenViewHolder.show]
 *
 * - If [ScreenViewHolder.canShow] returns false, it is time to tear your [ScreenViewHolder]
 *   down. Be sure to call
 *   [WorkflowLifecycleOwner.destroyOnDetach][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.androidx.WorkflowLifecycleOwner.destroyOnDetach]
 *   on the managed [view][ScreenViewHolder.view]!
