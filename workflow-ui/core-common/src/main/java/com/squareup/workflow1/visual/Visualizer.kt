/**
 * Support class for containers (stubs) that can show a series of renderings that
 * might be of different types or [incompatible][compatible], and so require different
 * factories and holders.
 *
 * Provides the hooks needed for lifecycle management, including
 * view state concerns, so that creation of a [VisualHolder] is decoupled from the
 * first call to its [VisualHolder.update] function. This is achieved via the
 * `onNewVisual` lambda that callers must provide to [show]. That lambda
 * is passed another, `doFirstUpdate`, which must be called immediately (enforced
 * at runtime). The default value for `onNewVisual` does nothing else, and may be
 * all that is needed for Compose. If not, we should drop the default and force
 * callers to be thoughtful.
 *
 * Still working out exact per-app logistics, but expect to wind up with one
 * instance of this for each [VisualT] value in a system:
 *
 * - Android View
 * - Android Dialog
 * - @Composable fun () -> Unit
 *
 * And maybe a fourth for mapping Overlay to Compose's Dialog()? Or perhaps the third
 * flavor can cover that case too. Perhaps we'll decide that we always use classic
 * APIs for that.
