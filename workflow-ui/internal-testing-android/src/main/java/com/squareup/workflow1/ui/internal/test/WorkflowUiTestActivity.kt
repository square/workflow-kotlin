/**
 * Helper for testing workflow-ui code in UI tests.
 *
 * The content view of the activity is a [WorkflowViewStub], which you can control by calling
 * [setRendering].
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * 1. Create an `ActivityScenarioRule` or `AndroidComposeRule` and pass this activity type.
 * 2. In your `@Before` method, set the [viewEnvironment].
 * 3. In your tests, call [setRendering] to update the stub.
 *
 * You can also test configuration changes by calling `ActivityScenarioRule.recreate()`. By default,
 * the [viewEnvironment] and last rendering will be restored when the view is re-created. You can
 * also retain your own data by mutating [customNonConfigurationData]. If you don't want the
 * rendering to be automatically restored, set [restoreRenderingAfterConfigChange] to false before
 * calling `recreate()`.
