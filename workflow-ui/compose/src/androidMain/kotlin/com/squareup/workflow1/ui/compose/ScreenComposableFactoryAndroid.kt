     * This is effectively the logic of `WorkflowViewStub`, but translated into Compose idioms.
     * This approach has a few advantages:
     *
     *  - Avoids extra custom views required to host `WorkflowViewStub` inside a Composition. Its trick
     *    of replacing itself in its parent doesn't play nicely with Compose.
     *  - Allows us to pass the correct parent view for inflation (the root of the composition).
     *  - Avoids `WorkflowViewStub` having to do its own lookup to find the correct
     *    [ScreenViewFactory], since we already have the correct one.
     *  - Propagate the current `LifecycleOwner` from [LocalLifecycleOwner] by setting it as the
     *    [ViewTreeLifecycleOwner] on the view.
     *  - Propagate the current [OnBackPressedDispatcherOwner] from either
     *    [LocalOnBackPressedDispatcherOwner] or the [viewEnvironment],
     *    both on the [AndroidView] via [setViewTreeOnBackPressedDispatcherOwner],
     *    and in the [ViewEnvironment] for use by any nested [WorkflowViewStub]
     *
     * Like `WorkflowViewStub`, this function uses the [viewFactory] to create and memoize a
     * `View` to display the [rendering], keeps it updated with the latest [rendering] and
     * [environment], and adds it to the composition.
