/**
 * Renders [rendering] into the composition using this [ViewEnvironment]'s
 * [ScreenViewFactoryFinder] to generate the view.
 *
 * This function fulfills a similar role as [ScreenViewHolder] and [WorkflowViewStub],
 * but is much more convenient to use from Composable functions. Note that,
 * just as with [ScreenViewHolder] and [WorkflowViewStub], it doesn't matter whether
 * the factory registered for the rendering is using classic Android views or Compose.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```
 * data class FramedRendering<R : Any>(
 *   val borderColor: Color,
 *   val child: R
 * ) : ComposeRendering {
 *
 *   @Composable override fun Content(viewEnvironment: ViewEnvironment) {
 *     Surface(border = Border(borderColor, 8.dp)) {
 *       WorkflowRendering(child, viewEnvironment)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param rendering The workflow rendering to display.
 * @param modifier A [Modifier] that will be applied to composable used to show [rendering].
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if no factory can be found for [rendering]'s type.
