/**
 * A [ViewRegistry.Entry] that uses a [Composable] function to display [ScreenT].
 * This is the fundamental unit of Compose tooling in Workflow UI, the Compose analogue of
 * [ScreenViewFactory][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.ScreenViewFactory].
 *
 * [ScreenComposableFactory] is also a bit cumbersome to use directly,
 * so [ComposeScreen] is provided as a convenience. Most developers will
 * have no reason to work with [ScreenComposableFactory] directly, or even
 * be aware of it.
 *
 * - See [ComposeScreen] for a more complete description of using Compose to
 *   build a Workflow-based UI.
 *
 * - See [WorkflowRendering] to display a nested [Screen] from [ComposeScreen.Content]
 *   or from [ScreenComposableFactory.Content]
 *
 * Use [ScreenComposableFactory] directly if you need to prevent your
 * [Screen] rendering classes from depending on Compose at compile time.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     val fooComposableFactory = ScreenComposableFactory<FooScreen> { screen, _ ->
 *       Text(screen.message)
 *     }
 *
 *     val viewRegistry = ViewRegistry(fooComposableFactory, â€¦)
 *     val viewEnvironment = ViewEnvironment.EMPTY + viewRegistry
 *
 *     renderWorkflowIn(
 *       workflow = MyWorkflow.mapRendering { it.withEnvironment(viewEnvironment) }
 *     )

     * This is effectively the logic of `WorkflowViewStub`, but translated into Compose idioms.
     * This approach has a few advantages:
     *
     *  - Avoids extra custom views required to host `WorkflowViewStub` inside a Composition.
     *    Its trick of replacing itself in its parent doesn't play nicely with Compose.
     *  - Allows us to pass the correct parent view for inflation (the root of the composition).
     *  - Avoids `WorkflowViewStub` having to do its own lookup to find the correct
     *    [ScreenViewFactory], since we already have the correct one.
     *  - Propagate the current `LifecycleOwner` from [LocalLifecycleOwner] by setting it as the
     *    [ViewTreeLifecycleOwner] on the view.
     *  - Propagate the current [OnBackPressedDispatcherOwner] from either
     *    [LocalOnBackPressedDispatcherOwner] or the [viewEnvironment],
     *    both on the [AndroidView] via [setViewTreeOnBackPressedDispatcherOwner],
     *    and in the [ViewEnvironment] for use by any nested [WorkflowViewStub]
     *
     * Like `WorkflowViewStub`, this function uses the [viewFactory] to create and memoize a
     * `View` to display the [rendering], keeps it updated with the latest [rendering] and adds
     * it to the composition.
