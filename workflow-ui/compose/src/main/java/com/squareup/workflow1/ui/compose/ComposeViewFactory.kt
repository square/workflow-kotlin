 *
 * ## Nesting child renderings
 *
 * Workflows can render other workflows, and renderings from one workflow can contain renderings
 * from other workflows. These renderings may all be bound to their own [ViewFactory]s. Regular
 * [ViewFactory]s and [LayoutRunner]s use
 * [WorkflowViewStub][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.WorkflowViewStub] to recursively show nested
 * renderings using the [ViewRegistry][com.squareup.workflow1.ui.ViewRegistry].
 *
 * View factories defined using this function may also show nested renderings. Doing so is as simple
 * as calling [WorkflowRendering] and passing in the nested rendering. See the kdoc on that function
 * for an example.
 *
 * Nested renderings will have access to any
 * [composition locals][androidx.compose.runtime.CompositionLocal] defined in outer composable, even
 * if there are legacy views in between them, as long as the [ViewEnvironment] is propagated
 * continuously between the two factories.
 *
 * ## Initializing Compose context
 *
 * Often all the [composeViewFactory] factories in an app need to share some context – for example,
 * certain composition locals need to be provided, such as `MaterialTheme`. To configure this shared
 * context, call [withCompositionRoot] on your top-level [ViewEnvironment]. The first time a
 * [composeViewFactory] is used to show a rendering, its [Content] function will be wrapped
 * with the [CompositionRoot]. See the documentation on [CompositionRoot] for more information.
