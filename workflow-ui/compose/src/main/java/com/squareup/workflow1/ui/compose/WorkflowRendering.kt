/**
 * Renders [rendering] into the composition using this [ViewEnvironment]'s [ViewRegistry] to
 * generate the view.
 *
 * This function fulfills a similar role as [WorkflowViewStub], but is much more convenient to use
 * from Composable functions. Note, however, that just like [WorkflowViewStub], it doesn't matter
 * whether the factory registered for the rendering is using classic Android views or Compose.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * ```
 * data class FramedRendering<R : Any>(
 *   val borderColor: Color,
 *   val child: R
 * ) : ComposeRendering {
 *
 *   @Composable override fun Content(viewEnvironment: ViewEnvironment) {
 *     Surface(border = Border(borderColor, 8.dp)) {
 *       WorkflowRendering(child, viewEnvironment)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param rendering The workflow rendering to display. May be of any type for which a [ViewFactory]
 * has been registered in [viewEnvironment]'s [ViewRegistry].
 * @param modifier A [Modifier] that will be applied to composable used to show [rendering].
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if no factory can be found for [rendering]'s type.

     * This is effectively the logic of [WorkflowViewStub], but translated into Compose idioms.
     * This approach has a few advantages:
     *
     *  - Avoids extra custom views required to host `WorkflowViewStub` inside a Composition. Its trick
     *    of replacing itself in its parent doesn't play nicely with Compose.
     *  - Allows us to pass the correct parent view for inflation (the root of the composition).
     *  - Avoids `WorkflowViewStub` having to do its own lookup to find the correct [ViewFactory], since
     *    we already have the correct one.
     *  - Propagate the current [LifecycleOwner] from [LocalLifecycleOwner] by setting it as the
     *    [ViewTreeLifecycleOwner] on the view.
     *
     * Like `WorkflowViewStub`, this function uses the [originalFactory] to create and memoize a
     * [View] to display the [rendering], keeps it updated with the latest [rendering] and
     * [viewEnvironment], and adds it to the composition.
