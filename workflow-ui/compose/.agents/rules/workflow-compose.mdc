# Workflow Compose Guidelines

- Use `renderAsState` to bridge workflow renderings into Compose.
- Define rendering types as `Screen` data classes, rendered by Compose UI.
- Use `ViewEnvironment` for cross-cutting UI concerns (e.g., themes, navigation).
- Prefer `eventHandler("name")` for stable UI event callbacks.
