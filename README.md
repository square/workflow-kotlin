Workflow is an application framework that provides architectural primitives.

Workflow is:

* Written in and used for Kotlin and Swift
* A unidirectional data flow library that uses immutable data within each Workflow.
  Data flows in a single direction from source to UI, and events in a single direction
  from the UI to the business logic.
* A library that supports writing business logic and complex UI navigation logic as
  state machines, thereby enabling confident reasoning about state and validation of
  correctness.
* Optimized for composability and scalability of features and screens.
* Corresponding UI frameworks that bind Rendering data classes for “views”
  (including event callbacks) to Mobile UI frameworks for Android and iOS.
* A corresponding testing framework that facilitates simple-to-write unit
  tests for all application business logic and helps ensure correctness.

## Using Workflows in your project

### Maven Artifacts

Artifacts are hosted on Maven Central. If you're using Gradle, ensure `mavenCentral()` appears in
your `repositories` block, and then add dependencies on the following artifacts:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Maven Coordinates</th>
    <th>Depend on this if…</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow1:workflow-core-jvm:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You are writing a library module/project that uses Workflows, but you don't need to interact
    with the runtime from the outside.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow1:workflow-rx2:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You need to interact with RxJava2 from your Workflows.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow1:workflow-testing-jvm:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You are writing tests. This should only be included as a test dependency.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow1:workflow-ui-core-android:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You're writing an Android app that uses Workflows.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Lower-level Artifacts

Most code shouldn't need to depend on these directly. They should generally only be used to build
higher-level integrations with UI frameworks.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Maven Coordinates</th>
    <th>Depend on this if…</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow1:workflow-runtime-jvm:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You need to interact directly with the runtime, i.e. streams of renderings and outputs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow1:workflow-ui-core-common-jvm:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You are writing workflow-ui-android for another UI framework. Defines the core types used by
    that artifact.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Jetpack Compose support

[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) is the new UI toolkit for Android.
It is comparable to SwiftUI for iOS. The main UI artifacts in this repository support standard
Android Views, but various types of Compose integrations are provided under the
**[compose](/workflow-ui/compose)** folder.

You'll find workflow + compose info and documentation there.

## Resources

* Wondering why to use Workflow? See
  ["Why Workflow"](https://square.github.io/workflow/userguide/whyworkflow/)
* There is a [Glossary of Terms](https://square.github.io/workflow/glossary/)
* We have a [User Guide](https://square.github.io/workflow/userguide/concepts/)
  describing core concepts.
* For Kotlin (and Android), there is a codelab style
  [tutorial](https://github.com/square/workflow-kotlin/tree/main/samples/tutorial) in the repo.
* For Swift (and iOS), there is also a Getting Started
  [tutorial](https://github.com/square/workflow-swift/tree/main/Samples/Tutorial) in the repo.
* There are also a number of
  [Kotlin samples](https://github.com/square/workflow-kotlin/tree/main/samples)
  and [Swift samples](https://github.com/square/workflow-swift/tree/main/Samples).
